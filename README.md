# Ruby

This repository is just a collection of the few projects I did as a part of the interview process for one of the jobs I applied for. 

Ruby-helloworld was my test program. It is where I began to understand how Ruby works and what I can and cannot do with the language.

candy-shop was the interview assignment. I had to create a "Candy Shop" where I can sell candy. I had to create an inventory system for it.
